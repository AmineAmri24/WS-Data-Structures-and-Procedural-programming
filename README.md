For this algorithm, we will try to sum the unique numbers by comparing two tables (array).

As a first step, we compared the elements of the first tab (one by one) with all the elements of the seconde tab in order to identify any similarities and to sum only the unique numbers.
We did the same thing with the seconde tab.
at the end the algorithm will be able to give us the sum of the unique numbers that do not have their twins in both of tabs.
